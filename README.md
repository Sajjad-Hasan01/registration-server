# registration-server
## Server side of MERN Learning Project

Is a learning simple project for myself, that provides **SignUp**, **Login**, **Logout** and **Profile**, by using validated form.


I used:
* _**MongoDB**_ as a database
* _**Express.js**_ for server functions
* _**React.js**_ for front-end
* _**Node.js**_ to operate all that
